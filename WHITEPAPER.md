# Teleporta: A Decentralized Good Transportation System

## Abstract 

Traditional good transportation methods works by physically carrying the goods from one location to another
by one of the conventional methods, with trucks, trains, ships or cargo planes. This global transportation network is responsible
for almost 10% of world's total energy consumption, and 25% of the total CO2 emissions. It requires complex planning and operation,
with huge supply chain costs. In this paper, a new method of transportation, called *destroy-and-reproduce*, is proposed.
Also, a system, Teleporta, implementing this new method to make the transportation is explained. "Destroy-and-reproduce" totally
eliminates all the physical medium between the sender and receiver, including roads, rails, water and air ways, 
and requires only the blockchain-powered internet connection to operate, along with specially designed devices called **Smart Transporters**.
The whitepaper discusses in detail the components Teleporta includes, how the system operates, and advantages provided by it compored to traditional
transportation. Finally, some of the future applications are discussed. 

## Introduction

The transportation of goods from one location to another is a necessary but time-consuming process. The global transportation system
involves many parties, a variety of transportation devices such as trucks, trains, ships, marine vessels, and cargo planes, 
and a very complex operation system that tries to use the world-wide transportation network including roads, rails, airways and waterways.
This huge system is responsible for almost 10% of the world's total energy comsumption, %25 of the total CO2 emissions. It is estimated that
the system requires trillions of dollars annually to operate. Production companies must build their own transportation system to deliver their products 
to their customers. What is needed is one integrated good transportation system, which is fast, cheaper, decentralized and secure, 
which eliminates all this complex transportation network, *replacing it with only two devices at the sender's and receiver's side, and internet connection.* 

The conventional transportation system works based on the principle that goods must be physically carried
by a good-carrying device that must work on a physical network like rails or roads. In this paper, we propose a new method to make transportation. 
This method, called **destroy and reproduce**, eliminates the need for physically carrying the goods between sender and receiver, or producer and customer.
In destroy-and-reproduce method, there is no need for a physical medium like roads, rails, water and airways. 
Instead, it works with a global, peer-to-peer (P2P) internet connection that connects every sender and receiver of goods around the world.

## The System Components and Basic Operation

Teleporta needs two devices, called **Smart Transporters** on the sender's and receiver's side, and a blockchain-powered internet connection, to operate.
Each Smart Trasnporter includes a 3D scanner, a 3D printer and a 3D recycler. Then, a basic producedure of transportation is as follows:
1. The 3D scanner on the sender's side scans the good and creates the 3D model of the good, including the good's shape information and material information.
2. It sends this file to Smart Transporter on the receivers side, via the secure internet connection. 
3. The 3D printer on the receiver's side reproduces the good according to the file. It also informs the other device that the reproduction is done.
4. Getting this information, Smart Transformer in the sender's side destroys (recycles) the good, because it is no longer needed. If the good is wished
to be copied, the recycling phase can be eliminated.
5. For the transportation to be done securely, all the information will be stored to blockchain. 

This procedure is the basis of the *destroy-and-reproduce* method. The good will be recycled on the sender's side, and reproduced on the receiver's side again,
thus eliminating the physical carry phase. All the information about the good is virtually transported over the internet. This method allows for goods to be send
and received anywhere in the globe, in a decentralized way. Since there is no medium between sender and receiver, the transportation cannot be regulated, 
controlled, or prevented by a central authority.
