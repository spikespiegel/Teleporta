# Teleporta: A Decentralized Good Transportation System

## Abstract 

Traditional good transportation methods works by physically carrying the goods from one location to another
by one of the conventional methods, with trucks, trains, ships or cargo planes. This global transportation network is responsible
for almost 10% of world's total energy consumption, and 25% of the total CO2 emissions. It requires complex planning and operation,
with huge supply chain costs. In this Whitepaper, a new method of transportation, called *destroy-and-reproduce*, is proposed.
Also, a system, Teleporta, implementing this new method to make the transportation is explained. "Destroy-and-produce" totally
eliminates all the physical medium between the sender and receiver, including roads, rails, water and air ways, 
and requires only the blockchain-powered internet connection to operate, along with specially designed devices called **Smart Transporters**.
The whitepaper discusses in detail the components Teleporta includes, how the system operates, and advantages provided by it compored to traditional
transportation. Finally, some of the future applications are discussed.
