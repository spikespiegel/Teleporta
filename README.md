## Introduction

### The Goal
We aim to develop a global and decentralized good transportation system. The system is going to be automatic,
fast, cheap and secure. The system will allow any individual, company or institution to transport goods to 
any location in an automatic way, without the involvement of any third-party institutions.  

Normally, the transportation of goods from a location to another is done by physically carrying the goods 
on a physical medium, such as roads, rail, water, or air. The good is carried on trucks or trains, marine vessels
or cargo planes. This method is used for centuries. However, it is slow, expensive, consumes significant amount
of fuels, and responsible for greenhouse emissions. Here, we propose a new method to do this. 

We aim to eliminate all this physical carry phase, physical medium, and any device working on the medium, 
including trucks, trains, ships, airplanes, or even drones. *In Teleporta, there will be no physical medium 
between the sender and the receiver of the good, other than internet connection.*

## Transporting Physical Objects Only With Internet Connection? Is It Even Possible?

Instead of physical carry of goods, Teleporta will use a "destroy-and-reproduce" method. When we consider the initial and final situations
of the good, we can see that after the transportation, the good *vanishes* in the initial location, and *appears* in the final location. 
This vanishing and appearing of the good can be mimicked by *destroying* the good in the sender side, and *reproducing* it in the receiver side. 
The results of two different approaches are the same: the sender does not have the good any more, and the receiver has now have it! 
This way, the good can be considered as being *transported*, even though no physical carry is actually done. 

In this context, destruction of the good should be understood as *recycling*. The good in the sender side will be melt down to its raw material. 
This allows the reuse of this material in the other transportations. 

The internet connection is required for the synchronization of the destruction and production phases of sender and receiver. The receier needs 
to communicate over the internet to learn the information of how and when the good will be produced. The reproduced good must have the same 
properties with the good in the sender side. 

### Why This Idea Has Not Been Done Before? 

The "destroy-and-reproduce" idea was not possible in the past. The production of goods was either impossible or very costly, due to the need of 
different specialized manufacturing equipment. In this case, we would have to use different devices for each transportation, which would not be possible.
However, today, 3D printers allow us to make very generalized manufacturing, which can be used to make general transportations. Also, the blockchain invention 
allows us to keep track of each transportation, and produce a decentralized and automatic system. 


### Components and Basic Operation

Teleporta will involve three components: 
- the hardware system including a 3D printer, 3D scanner, and a 3D recycler. This system is called **Smart Transporter**. 
- internet connecting Smart Transporters. This system is called **Virtual Transportation System (VTS)**.
- the blockchain system called **Portal** that is responsible for the security and economics of transportation.

Basic Operation: Sender and receiver requires to have Smart Transporters, to be able to make the transportation. Then,
- The 3D scanner in the receiver side scans the good and generates a file, consisting on the 3D digital model of the good with its shape and dimensions, 
and material information. The good in this side good will then be unnecessary, and can be recycled by melting. 
- The file will be sent to the receiver side via the internet. 
- The 3D printer in the receiver side reproduces the good according to the information on the file. 
- All this information will be stored on the blockchain, so that the transportations can be secured and verified. 


### Advantages of Teleporta Over Traditional Transportation

The traditional transportation system is based on the physical carry of goods by a transportation device, generally trucks, trains, ships or planes. 
The energy consumption in good transportation (passenger transportation data not included) corresponds to 9% of the total energy consumptions in the world. 
The CO2 emissions due to the good transportation is responsible for the 10% of global emissions. 
Global freight transportation costs are estimated to reach to trillions of dollars annually. 

Transportation of goods between the producers and customers involves a complex supply chain process. 
This supply chain involves the movement of goods from the factory to customers via air, water, rail or road ways. 
In average, the supply chain process is responsible for the 66% of the total production cost of a product.
The production companies and institutions must spend billions of dollars to plan and operate this supply chain system. 
Each company or institution must either construct their own logistics system, or collaborate third party transportation companies to make the transportation. 
Individuals almost always resort to third party transportation companies when they wish to send or receive goods from each other, and from companies and institutions. 
In some situations, the cost of the transportation is even higher than the price of the good itself.  

The system is slow, human-based, and expensive. It is not environment-friendly. It is indirect, complex, hard to operate and maintain. 
Teleporta will not have these disadvantages. 
- By eliminating the physical medium and transportation devices, it will eliminate supply chain costs. Only a small fee will be required to use Teleporta. (for blockchain operations)
- It is direct and simple. It will only have two Smart Transporters on the sender and receiver sides, together with the blockchain and internet systems. 
- It will work automatically and securely, without any third parties and human-intervention.
- It is sustainable. It eliminates fuel consumptions and CO2 emissions caused by good transportation.
