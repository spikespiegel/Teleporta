# Contributing Teleporta

Thank you for your interest in Teleporta. Any contribution is greatly appreciated. 
We want to build a decentralized, fast, very cheap, almost-free, simple-to-use transportation
system which anyone can use anywhere around the world without any control. 

## Help us to build our community!   

Our main aim is to make Teleporta globally accessible. 
Everyone in the world should be easily access to it or its components (both software and hardware).
This is why we are designing it open source, and this is why we need your help! 

## Growing together

Blockchain technology and 3D printers have big open-source communities behind them. It is better to grow with them together!
 
## Contributing to design of Teleporta

At the Teleporta's core are three independent revolutionary technologies. 
We are trying to combine these technologies in a unique and creative way to develop 
a new technology. We need to design the necessary hardware by combining 3D systems, 
we need to design our blockchain-powered system, we need to write tons of code... 
Thus, we need people with any level of experience on each of these technologies.
All of people who understands a small bit about technology is welcome! 

## I am not a tech guy, but I want to contribute.

We love to hear this. There are lots of thing to be done here. You can share ideas, 
make documentations, contact with open-source 3D communities, manage our social media
accounts and lots of other things. 

## I don't know how to start contributing, what should I do? 

You can start by sharing Teleporta. We want world-wide adoption of the system, so it would be 
very nice if people hear about it. 

## I don't want to contribute, I just came by to see what this stuff is about. 

Sit back and enjoy the show! You are witnessing the development of a groundbreaking technology. 
You will soon start sending goods anywhere, cheaply and easily. We are developing this technology for you.
