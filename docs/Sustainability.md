## State-of-the-art In Traditional Transportation

Transportation of goods from one place to another is a necessary, but a costly and time-consuming process. 
According to International Energy Outlook 2016, the good and people transportation is about 25% of the worldâ€™s total energy consumption.
Energy consumption due to transportation (both freight and passenger transportation) increases at an annual average rate of 1.4%, 
estimated to reach 155 quadrillion BTU (British thermal units) in 2040. 
The freight transportation corresponds to the transportation of products or raw and intermediate material to the customers via road (trucks),
rail, pipeline and water transportation. In 2012, this kind of transportation corresponds to 39% of the total transportation in the world, 
with truck energy consumption being 23%, marine vessel energy consumption 12%, 
and rail and pipeline energy consumption 4% of the total energy consumption due to overall transportation. 
The freight energy consumption is expected to increase 1.5% per year. By the year 2040, according to projections, this value reaches 60 quadrillion BTU.
The amount of energy consumption due to good transportation annually corresponds to almost 9% of the global energy consumption. 


## Sustainability Considerations

Production and transportation of goods must be done in a sustainable way, with the least energy consumption, fuel and material costs possible. 
Desing of Teleporta must be done with these considerations in mind. The transportation system must not only be fast and cheap, but it must also be green,
including less or no fuel consumptions. It must be integrated with the production concept so that no waste of materials occurs. 
These hard and mostly conflicting needs can be fullfilled by introducing the concept *produce-on-the-fly*. 
In Teleporta, the 3D printing systems are used for dual purpose, for the production and for the transportation. 
The goods can be produced and destroyed (reused) on the transportation, which is called **dynamic production**. 
We know that the global fuel consumption, caused mostly by the transportation system, is harmful to the nature of the world. 
This fuel consumption causes global warming, and climate change by emitting greenhouse gases. Teleporta will provide the elimination of the fuel consumption by making the
transportation with 3D machines, instead of trucks, marine vessels or cargo planes. 
Reusability of products is an important issue in production systems.
To reduce the material waste, the products return to production factories where they are converted to their raw materials to be reproduced later. 
Teleporta will provides this reusability with each transportation, thanks to its 3D Recycler system. 
After each transportation, the goods in the sender side will be converted to its raw materials, ensuring that there is no material waste. 
This raw material can then be used in other transportations.
The production, transportation, and waste-removal systems complement each other.
It is our vision that developing a fast and more economic transportation system allows increasing efficiency of other systems.
