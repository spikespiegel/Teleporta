# Teleporta Operation Modes 

For flexibility and efficiency, Teleporta will allow for different modes of good transportation, which use slightly different transportation procedures.
These procedures are explained below for explanation purposes. When using Teleporta, the users do not have to know the details of these procedures,
nor they have to provide any information other than simple mode selection. All details will be handled automatically by Teleporta.
Also, users will pay the fees according to mode selection. The fees will be determined by the operations included in the transportation. 
Teleporta users will be able to define and use their own modes. This capability is important when producers, sellers, or 
individuals wish to use other procedures than defined. Existing modes can be combined, or new steps can be added to define new modes. 

1.	Regular mode: This is the default mode in Teleporta. It will assume that the sender has a physical item to be transported. This mode will mostly be used by individuals who 
wish to send goods to each other, or from one place to another. This mode will also allow for copying items within the transportation. The simplified procedure in this mode is as follows: 
    -	The 3D scanner in the sender side scans the good and creates a file that generates the 3D digital model of the good, including its shape and dimensions, and material information.
    -	The file will be sent to the 3D system of the receiver via the internet. 
    -	The 3D printer of the receiver reproduces the good with the help of the file. 
    -	The 3D system of the receiver sends back the information that the product is successfully re-produced in the receiver side.
    -	After getting this information the 3D recycler in the sender side converts the good into its raw material, so that this material can be re-used in other transportations.  
    -	The sender sends the information that the conversion is done, and announcing that the transportation is complete. 
    -	All the information included in the transportation process is stored in blockchain.

2.	Copy mode: There will be two copy modes in Teleporta.
    -	Users want to copy the item in both sides. In this case, the 3D recycler step in the regular mode is eliminated. Other steps are applied as mentioned.
    -	When a single user wishes to copy his/her item without transportation. In this case, Teleporta can be used as a production device. The procedure is:
          - The 3D scanner on the Smart Transporter scans the good and creates the file including 3D digital model of the item. 
          - The file is directly sent to the 3D printer of the Smart Transporter. 
          -	The 3D printer reproduces the item. All communications are done inside the Metaporter.
          -	The item is copied. The information will be stored to blockchain. 

3.	Designer mode: This mode is used when the sender does not have a physical item, but only have the 3D model file. This mode is mostly used by production companies, designers and customers. This mode allows elimination of production costs for production companies, because they can only sell their designs without manufacturing the actual physical product. In the designer mode, the item is manufactured on the customer’s side. The procedure is: 
    -	Smart Transporter in the designer’s side sends the 3D model file to the customer. There is no scanning process in this case. 
    -	The Smart Transporter in the customer’s side manufactures the product.
    -	It sends the verification information that the transportation is complete.
    -	All the necessary information is stored in blockchain. 

4.	Virtual Transportation Mode: This mode allows only the virtual transportation to take place. This mode is used when it is not wished to produce the item physically at the end of the production. When the virtual transportation happens, the receiver is now the owner of the Intellectual Property Token (IPT), which refers to and represents the physical item. Being the owner of the token, the receiver can now produce the physical item any time. It is a subclass of regular mode or designer mode depending on whether the sender has a physical item or a 3D model of the item. 

5. 	Non-fungible Physical Item (NFPI) mode: Non-fungible physical items (NFPI) are the physical equivalent of the non-fungible tokens. They are unique and have no copies. They mostly are valuable physical items like paintings, sculptor, items with historical value. These items must be transported with care. The transportation procedure is the same with the regular mode, but with special parameters to protect the originality of the product. In this transportation, copy mode cannot be used.

6.	User-defined mode: Users define their own procedures with Teleporta’s user-friendly and ease-to-use procedure design system. Users can develop procedures according to their wishes, and use these modes in their own transportations. This added programmability allows the users to use Teleporta in efficient and smart ways.
