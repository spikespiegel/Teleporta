# Key Terminology 

**Teleporta:** The good transportation system that we are designing. Teleporta will eliminate the use of trucks, marine vessels, cargo planes
and any intermediate human-based supply chain operations, costs, and fuel consumptions. 
Instead, it will use an automatic, fast, cheap, and direct transportation using 3D machines â€“ 3D printers, scanners, and recyclers. 
Teleporta will three components: Portal, Smart Transporter, and Virtual Transportation System (VTS).

**Portal:** The blockchain system used in Teleporta. Also, the name of the main token in Teleporta ecosystem. 
Portal will be used for the security of transportations and responsible for all the economic activities in Teleporta, 
including transportation fees, and payments between providers and customers. Users must own Portal to use Teleporta ecosystem.   

**Smart Transporter:** The hardware system responsible for the transportation. It includes a 3-in-1 hardware unit including a 3D scanner, 3D printer, and 3D recycler.

**Virtual Transportation System (VTS):** The internet connection system between Smart Transporters. It connects all Metaporters in the world. 
It will make the Teleporta ecosystem cheap and fast. It also makes decentralized transportation possible. 
Virtual transportation system includes file transfer protocols and communication protocols that allows the information sharing between any two Smart Transporters.

**3D printer:** A necessary key component in the Smart Transporters. It has a very important operation in Teleporta together with 3D scanners and 3D recyclers. 
[3D printers](3D_Printers.md) are revolutionary additive manufacturing devices used in a variety of industrial sectors such as medicine, automotive, aerospace, construction.

**3D scanner:** An important key component in Smart Transporters. It will be used to scan a physical item and construct a file 
that describes physical features of the item including dimension, shape, and material information.

**3D recycler:** It will melt down a shaped item into its raw material so that this material could be used later. 
It will be mostly used in Teleporta for recycling after a transportation, 
but also has other important functions such as making possible the transportation of *non-fungible physical items (NFPI)*.

**Decentralized Transportation:** A new concept in transportation. 
It is described as the direct transportation of goods between any individual, company or institution without any intermediate medium.

**Non-fungible tokens (NFT):** Tokens that represent unique items, either physical or non-physical. 
There are no copies of these items and objects. The tokens describe the ownership rights of these items.

**Intellectual Property (IP):** Any design or abstract object, owned and sold by an individual, institution or company. 
These objects are mostly abstract descriptions of physical items, which can be manufactured or produced by other companies, individual or institutions.

**Intellectual Property Token (IPT):** A subclass of NFTs used in Teleporta ecosystem. 
These tokens will directly represent physical items that are transported. 
Users will be able to own or sell these tokens, which implies the ownership of physical items themselves. 
When consumers wish to buy a good from a producer, they must buy the token that represents the item, which implies that the physical item is exchanged. 
Portal is used to own or sell these tokens.

**Non-fungible physical items (NFPI):** The unique physical items like valuable paintings, sculptors, historical objects. 
They are the physical analogues of NFTs. To transport these items from one place to another, Transportal uses special parameters and modes of transportation.
