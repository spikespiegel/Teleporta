# Conceptual Understanding 

This file provides information about Teleporta for better understanding of the system. 
Also check out [key terminology](Key_Terminology.md) to follow easily.

## How Teleporta Works? 

Traditionally, good transportation is done by physically carrying the goods from one place to another.
When a sender sends a good to a receiver, the good is carried on roads, rails, water or air, via trucks, trains, vessels or cargo planes. 
This system is used for centuries. Now, Teleporta changes this method dramatically.


## Is There Any Physical Medium Between Sender And Receiver?

No. There are no roads, no rails, no airways or waterways between sender and receiver. Trucks, marine vessels, cargo planes, or even drones are not used. 
The only medium that exists between the sender and receiver is the internet connection, called Virtual Transportation System, or VTS.

## How Will The System Work?

The underlying idea behind Teleporta is to eliminate the physical medium between senders and receivers. 
To accomplish this, Teleporta will totally eliminate the physical carry of goods. Instead, it uses the revolutionary “destroy-and-reproduce” concept. 
In Teleporta, the good will be destroyed (recycled) at the sender side, and reproduced at the receiver side. 
It will “vanish” at the sender, and “appear” at the receiver. This way, the good would essentially be transported, without any physical carry operation.
The destroy-and-reproduce concept is equivalent to the physical carry of goods, but it provides advantages. 

## Why Destroy-And-Reproduce Approach Is More Advantageous Than The Traditional Physical Carry Method?

When two approaches are compared, the “destroy-and-reproduce” concept becomes more economically and environmentally feasible,
because it eliminates all complex supply chain costs, all the good-carrying devices like trucks or ships, along with the fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
It replaces the whole transportation system with only two devices, called Smart Transporters, on the sender and receiver sides.

## Was This Approach Possible In The Past?
No. In the past, the reproduction of the good in the receiver side could not be done due to technological limitations. 
It was either impossible to manufacture the good without specialized equipment, or the manufacturing was too slow, or expensive. 
However, with the invention of revolutionary 3D printers, today goods can be manufactured in a cheap and fast way.

## Is It Possible to Transport *Any Good* By Teleporta?
Unfortunately, no. Teleporta depends heavily on 3D printers to make the reproduction in the transportation. Therefore, goods that cannot be produced by a 3D printer cannot be transported by Teleporta. Some of the transportation classes that are not possible to transport with Teleporta are:

1. liquid (water, petroleum, etc) and gas (oxygen, natural gas, etc) transportation
2. Raw material transportation
3. Chemical and mixture transportation
4. Animal, plant and living organism transportation
5. Passenger transportation

Other than these classes, the nanodevices are out of range of productivity of 3D printers yet. At present, 3D printers can only manufacture goods in the micron range.
High technology nano-range products like chips, SoCs, FPGAs, cannot yet be transported. However, with the improvements in the 3D technology, 
the class of products that can be produced by 3D machines and transported by Teleporta will increase each day.

## Will Teleporta Be Cheaper Than Traditional Transportation?

Yes. It is one of the main ideas behind Teleporta to eliminate all complex supply chain operations and costs. Instead, users will only need to pay a small fee to
make the transportation. [Portal](Economics_In_Teleporta.md) will be responsible for the economical operations in Teleporta.


## What About Sustainability? Will Teleporta Be More Environmental-Friendly?

Yes. [Sustainability](Sustainability.md), fuel consumptions and greenhouse gas emissions are the most important problems in the traditional transportation. 
Teleporta aims to solve this important problem. It will eliminate all good-carry devices like trucks, ships or trains, and with them being eliminated,
all the fuel consumption and gas emissions due to good transportation will be eliminated.

## What Is Decentralized Transportation?

**Decentralized Transportation** is key term coined by Teleporta. It means the transportation being done in a peer-to-peer way, without no control or any involvement 
of third-party institutions. People, companies or institutions will be able to send and receive goods directly from each other without any intermediate system. 
To accomplish such a task, Teleporta will use the "destroy-and-reproduce" approach, and eliminate all the physical medium between sender and receiver.
There will exist only the internet connection powered by blockchain technology between the sender and receiver. 

## Security? Can Transportations Be Verified?

Yes. We aim to use the blockchain technology for this purpose. This way, transportations can be tracked, verified, and processed in a secure way. 
[Portal](Economics_In_Teleporta.md) will be the blockchain system in Teleporta. It will be responsible for the security and verification of transportations.

## What are Intellectual Property Tokens? 

Intellectual Property Tokens are a special subclass of Non-funginle Tokens (NFT) that corresponds to physical objects to be transformed. 
In Teleporta, each transported item will be represented by IPTs.
